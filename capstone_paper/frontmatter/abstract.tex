\section{Abstract}
\noindent
This project investigates the role of large language models (LLMs) in the early-stage design of drone light shows. Rather than assume their utility, we explore whether language-based agents can meaningfully assist professionals in generating and refining swarm choreographies. Through literature review, prototype development, and evaluative experiments, we aim to identify where LLMs help, where they hinder, and how they can be reframed as collaborative tools. Our work contributes insights toward building more interpretable, practical, and user-centered systems â€” bridging the gap between creative intent and executable formations.
